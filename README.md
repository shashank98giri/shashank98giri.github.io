# Personal Blog 
This is my personal blog page which I would try to update as frequent as possible by the extra things done by me in Computer Science field.
<br>This site has been built using Jekyll framework. <br>
Jekyll is a ruby framwork which has some extra advantages because one can use markdown for writing posts not bothering about its html equivalent.
To find more about jekyll and its advantages go to this [site](https://jekyllrb.com/).
